## Features

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - **Sign up / Login**: Secure sign-up and login functionality allowing users to create accounts and access the platform.
   - **JWT Tokens**: User sessions are managed with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can write or modify blog posts.
   - **User Roles**: Different user roles (e.g., Admin, User) allow for access control. Admins can manage posts and users, while normal users can create and edit their own posts.

### 2. **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations**
   - **Create**: Authenticated users can create blog posts through an easy-to-use editor.
   - **Read**: Users can browse the blog posts on the homepage, filter by categories, and search for specific topics.
   - **Update**: Users can edit their posts if they are logged in and have the necessary permissions.
   - **Delete**: Admins can delete inappropriate or outdated posts from the platform.

### 3. **Cloud-Based Storage**
   - **File Uploads**: Images and media files associated with blog posts are stored in cloud storage (AWS S3).
   - **Scalable Storage**: As the platform grows, the cloud infrastructure allows seamless scalability for handling large numbers of media uploads and user data.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
   - The platform is built to be fully responsive, ensuring that users have a seamless experience across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
   - Uses **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** to ensure the layout adapts to various screen sizes.

### 5. **Search Functionality**
   - The blog allows users to search for specific posts based on keywords, categories, or tags.
   - Search results are displayed in real-time, offering suggestions as the user types.

### 6. **User Profile and Settings**
   - Each user has a personal profile page displaying their own posts and information.
   - Users can update their profile information and change their password.

### 7. **Comment Section**
   - Users can leave comments on posts, enabling interaction between the readers and the bloggers.
   - **Spam Protection**: Captchas or other spam detection mechanisms can be integrated to prevent bot-generated comments.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend**
   - **HTML/CSS**: Standard web technologies to create the basic structure and design of the blog page.
   - **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Enhances interactivity and enables dynamic loading of content.
   - **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: Templating engine used to generate HTML pages dynamically on the server-side.
   - **Bootstrap 4/5**: Used to build a responsive design and provide a sleek, modern look to the interface.

### **Backend**
   - **Node.js**: The backend server is built with Node.js, which provides an asynchronous, event-driven environment for handling requests and responses efficiently.
   - **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing, middleware management, and handling HTTP requests.
   - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store blog posts, user information, comments, and other application data. MongoDB's scalability is perfect for growing blog platforms.
   - **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library used to interact with MongoDB.

### **Authentication & Authorization**
   - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for managing user authentication securely without storing session data on the server.
   - **Bcrypt**: A library used to hash user passwords before storing them in the database, adding an extra layer of security.

### **Cloud Integration**
   - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Cloud services, such as **Amazon S3**, are used to store images, files, and other media content uploaded by users. This ensures that the application can scale and handle large media files.
   - **AWS EC2**: The application is hosted on AWS EC2 instances for high availability and scalability.
   - **AWS RDS**: Optionally, AWS RDS can be used for managing a relational database (if needed for future enhancements).

### **Docker**
   - The application is containerized using **Docker** to ensure portability and consistency across different environments.
   - Docker containers are used to package the application with its dependencies, ensuring that the app runs consistently regardless of the deployment environment.
